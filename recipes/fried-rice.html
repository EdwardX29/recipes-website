        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Bring the rice and water to boil in saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to
                medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed,
                20-25 minutes. Let the rice cool completely
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat 2 teaspoons of oil in a skillet over medium heat, and brown the luncheon meat and sausage.
                 Set aside, and pour the beaten eggs into the hot skillet. Scramble the eggs, and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat, and stir in the rice. 
                Toss the rice with the hot oil until heated through and beginning to brown, about 2 minutes. 
                Add the garlic powder, toss the rice for 1 more minute to develop the garlic taste, and stir 
                in the luncheon meat, sausage, scrambled eggs, pineapple, and oyster sauce. Cook and stir 
                until the oyster sauce coats the rice and other ingredients, 2 to 3 minutes, stir in the 
                green onions, and serve.
